You need to download some files to follow this lesson:

1. Download [shell-novice-data.zip]({{ page.root }}/data/shell-novice-data.zip) and move the file to your Desktop.
2. Unzip/extract the file (ask your instructor if you need help with this step). You should end up with a new folder called data-shell on your Desktop.
3. Open a terminal and type:

If you are on a Windows machine, it would be useful to download an installer
which will add a bash shell, and a couple of other useful utilities:
[SWC Windows installer](https://github.com/swcarpentry/windows-installer/releases/tag/v0.3).

Another possibility is to connect to a remote machine with
[Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/).

~~~
$ cd
~~~
{: .bash}

In the lesson, you will find out how to access the data in this folder.
