You need to download some files to follow this lesson:

1. Download [data-shell.zip]({{ page.root }}/data/data-shell.zip) and move the file to your Desktop.
2. Unzip/extract the file (ask your instructor if you need help with this step). You should end up with a new folder called **data-shell** on your Desktop.
3. Open a terminal and type `cd`, then press the Enter key. That last step will make sure you start with your home folder as your working directory.

~~~
$ cd
~~~
{: .bash}

That last step will make sure you start with your home folder as your working directory.

> ## Where to type commands: How to open a new shell
> The shell is a program that enables us to send commands to the computer and receive output. It is also referred to as the terminal or command line.
>
> Some computers include a default Unix Shell program. 
> The steps below describe some methods for identifying and opening a Unix Shell program if you already have one installed. 
> There are also options for identifying and downloading a Unix Shell program, a Linux/UNIX emulator, or a program to access a Unix Shell on a server. 
>
> If none of the options below address your circumstances, try an online search for: Unix shell [your computer model] [your operating system].
>
> ### Linux
> The default Unix Shell for Linux operating systems is usually Bash.
> On most versions of Linux, it is accessible by running the [(Gnome) Terminal](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-terminal/stable/)
> or [(KDE) Konsole](https://konsole.kde.org/)
> or [xterm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm),
> which can be found via the applications menu or the search bar.
> If your machine is set up to use something other than bash, you can run it by opening a terminal and typing `bash`.
>
> ### MacOS
> For a Mac computer, the default Unix Shell is Bash,
> and it is available via the `Terminal` application.
>
> To open Terminal, try one or both of the following:
> * Go to your Applications. Within Applications, open the Utilities folder. Locate Terminal in the Utilities folder and open it.
> * Use the Mac ‘Spotlight’ computer search function. Search for: `Terminal` and press <kbd>Return</kbd>.
>
> ### Windows
> Computers with Windows operating systems do not automatically have a Unix Shell program installed.
> In this lesson, we encourage you to use an emulator included in Git for Windows, 
> which gives you access to both Bash shell commands and Git. 
> If you are attending a Software Carpentry workshop session, it is likely you have already received instructions on how to install Git for Windows.
>
> Once installed, you can open a terminal by running the program Git Bash from the Windows start menu.
>
> Other solutions are available for running Bash commands on Windows. 
> There is now a Bash shell command-line tool available for Windows 10. 
> Additionally, you can run Bash commands on a remote computer or server that already has a Unix Shell, from your Windows machine. 
> This can usually be done through a Secure Shell (SSH) client. 
> One such client available for free for Windows computers is PuTTY. 
> See the reference below for information on installing and using PuTTY, 
> using the Windows 10 command-line tool, or installing and using a Unix/Linux emulator.
